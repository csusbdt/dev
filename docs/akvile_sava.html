<p>
The beings that control this reality are consummate salesmen.
</p>

<p>
They are going to sweeten the Earth deal to keep as many souls here as possible.
</p>

<p>
There's going to be a new age, characterized by the restoration of peace and harmony.
</p>

<p>
But it won't come instantly.
</p>

<p>
We will need to work for it.
</p>

<p>
They will try to sell you the idea that you are needed for this transformation.
</p>

<p>
They will try to make us think we are needed here to accomplish this great task.
</p>

<p>
We get to decide whether to continue with immersion in the Earth story,
in this video game.
</p>

<p>
You get to be one of the heros.
</p>

<p>
But you toil under artificial limitations,
put in place to implement the story world.
</p>

<p>
Born without memory of other existences.
</p>

<p>
Imprinted with false memories.
